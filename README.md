# Analyzing missed doctor appointments
This project was created as part of the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
'Data Analyst' nano-degree program.
It investigates a
[Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments), which
includes anonymized data about ~100,000 medical appointments in Brazil.
The aim of this project is to study some factors that may contribute to a
patient missing their scheduled appointment.

## Main file
All the analysis, including data wrangling, visualizations and drawing
conclusions is performed in the main file
[missed_doc_apptmnt.ipynb](missed_doc_apptmnt.ipynb).
A static rendered version of the notebook can be found in
[missed_doc_apptmnt.html](missed_doc_apptmnt.html).

## Requirements
Requirements for this project are listed in the file
[DA_proj2.yaml](DA_proj2.yaml).
